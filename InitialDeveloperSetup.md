## Final Note

- Maintain professionalism in your GitLab profiles and repositories.
- Follow good commit practices.
- Reach out to the Tech Leads in case of any issues.

### This setup is your foundationâ€”take it seriously and complete it thoroughly.

**Letâ€™s begin our journey! ðŸš€**


## Good Commit Practices

Throughout the internship, you will be using Git for version control and collaboration. It is essential to follow good commit practices to ensure clarity and traceability in your work.

### Best Practices:

- Use meaningful commit messages (e.g., `add: implemented login API` instead of `update` or `fix` alone)
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use conventional commit formats when possible
- Regularly push your changes to the remote repository

Following these practices will help you maintain a professional codebase and make collaboration smoother.

Stay consistent with your tasks, report issues responsibly, and make the most out of this internship journey into AI and open-source development.
